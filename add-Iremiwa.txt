Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free, GitHub Pro,
 and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team 
 and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "GitHub's products."

When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for 
review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are 
not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. For more information about 
creating a draft pull request, 
see "Creating a pull request" and "Creating a pull request from a fork."
